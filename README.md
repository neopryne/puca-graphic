Turn your data into other data!

Takes the raw data of the file and encodes it in the rgb channels of a png file, adding enough empty space to the end to make it a rectangle.

Right now the only intermediate format supported is .png, but I plan to add more in the future.  Also to make the UI less boring.

Files encode their original endings in parentheses, defaulting to .txt if none is found.
